        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>The Habit Tracker will be an adaptive and personalized scheduling app that keeps up with users’ changing and complex schedules to develop, control, and predict habits to form a more productive and healthy lifestyle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column ">
        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The Habit Tracker will be used by people interested in journaling their habits, habit development, and healthy lifestyles. Users will be able to monitor progress toward cementing a habit into their daily/weekly routine. This will include anything from practicing an instrument consistently to exercising three times a week and sleeping more than seven hours a night</p>

Also, I learned Test-driven development and how it can be used to make sure the project meets the requirements defined for it. This project was my first time being exposed to git and realizing how important it is to keep the project repository organized and structured.</p>

                        <p>Through out the development of this application I have increased my appreciation for and developed my skills in SOLID principles and Agile design. There is an art and skill to applying them correctly, but when learnt and applied, they do wonders at developing ideas and dream into functional building blocks of a larger projects. Making them integral tools in bringing this project to fruition.</p>

                        <p>Developing this application taught me how to work with a team.
                            This included breaking user stories into smaller, more manageable development tasks, and how these tasks were distributed amongst team members.
                            Having regular communication allowed the team to monitor progress, identify problem areas and reallocate resourses to ensure that the releases of the application were completed on time.</p>

                    <p> Through out the development of this application, I learned the importance of unit testing and establishing strong communication channels with the other developers.  With unit testing we could quickly identify if some component of our app was misbehaving without having to do some extensive digging for the root cause of a bug.  </p>

        <h1 class="title">Postmortem</h1>

            <p>In the iteration 2 retrospective, we identified communicating when someone completed a task or needed assistance with a task as an issue. This improved in iteration 3 as everyone made an effort to let the other members of the team know when changes were made or assistance was needed.
            </p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">If we started over…</h2><p>
            If we had the chance to start over, we would re-estimate the amount of time required for each feature. We overestimated almost all of our features as we didnt know how android studio worked.
    </p><h2 class="subtitle is-5"> Project Evolution</h2>
            <p>During the planning process, we had too many features scheduled to be completed in each iteration which lead to at least 1 feature needing to be moved in each iteration. This was mainly because we planned for each team member to complete a feature but didnt plan for someone to do the documentation, tests and Git management. We also re-evaluated the priorities of the features in iteration 2 as we had a better understanding about what was feasible to accomplish in android studio.
            </p><h2 class="subtitle is-5"> What took the most time:</h2>
           <p> During the early stages of planning, we had discussed doing a notification feature. However, this ended up being more difficult than expected as it needed to be moved from iteration 1 where it was scheduled, to the future. The information we found about how to implement notifications in android studio was for an older version, so it was difficult to translate to the version we were currently using. In iteration 2, we didn't have a place to integrate the notifications in. In iteration 3 there were unforeseen conflicts integrating the notification feature and subsequently testing it, so it was moved to the future.
           </p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">  What we learned about project dev:</h2>
          <p>  Completing this project taught us that if 2 features need to be in the same form, it’s best if the same person does both of those features, otherwise there is too much time wasted waiting for each other to complete the feature. It also taught us that communication is key to a successful project.  If we were to work on another project together, we would start doing more scrum meetings where we reported on the code completed that day and problems we were having.
