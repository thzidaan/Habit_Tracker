# Our Vision

The Habit Tracker will be an adaptive and personalized scheduling app that keeps up with users’ changing and complex schedules to develop, control, and predict habits to form a more productive and healthy lifestyle.

# Target Audience
The Habit Tracker will be used by people interested in journaling their habits, habit development, and healthy lifestyles. Users will be able to monitor progress toward cementing a habit into their daily/weekly routine. This will include anything from practicing an instrument consistently to exercising three times a week and sleeping more than seven hours a night

# Function
The Habit Tracker will monitor users' progress through the use of a personal account that the user can create on the app. The existence of a personal account allows the user to manage their personal habits by adding new habits, removing existing habits the user no longer wants to continue, and allowing the user to edit existing habits to update them so that they continue to reflect their interests. The user can set habits based on a specific time of day or by blocks of time (morning, afternoon, evening or night). They will also be able to set reminders for creating habits. These reminders can be set at a specific time or by blocks of time to encourage the user to develop habits when they have time to do so. The user can set an in-app reminder or to set a reminder that occurs when the app is closed (push notifications).

The Habit Tracker provides a calendar for viewing scheduled habits. The calendar will be personalized to individual users preferences. The calendar settings will allow the user to change the amount of days displayed in the calendar view. They will also have the option to only display the habits scheduled for the current day, the habits scheduled for the current week, or the habits scheduled for the current month.

Once a scheduled habit development event is completed, users can mark that habit event as such. The system will then collect information about how often that habit event has been completed so that the user can view their habit patterns and use it to determine if they want to alter the habit or see how well they have integrated a habit into their life.

Users will also be able to combine existing habits together so that the app can track the overall progress of the habit group (an example is music practice across multiple instruments). Habit progress will be reported to the user, and they can share this information with social media. Users will also be able to take notes on each habit when one of the habit events has been completed.. Habit notes will be stored within the information about the habit. These notes are intended to help the user recognize which habits they are enjoying and which produce a positive outcome in their life.

Unlike other progress tracking apps on the market, the Habit Tracker will feature the ability to adaptively suggest habits to add to the users’ schedule. Habits will be suggested based on a few criteria. Habits that are scheduled to occur multiple times during a week that have not been completed will be suggested to fill the free time of the user. If the user shows the preference to complete habits that belong to a certain habit group, then another habit belonging to the same group would be suggested to fill the free time, and habits trends will be extracted from the user’s history to suggest the best weekly/monthly schedule that the user enjoys and is able to semi-successfully complete.

# Measurement of Success
The success of the app will be measured through a few criteria. The users will be requested to express their opinion about the application. This user feedback will consist of how usable the app is and if they are satisfied with how demanding the app is to develop habits. They will be asked to rate it out of five stars and the team will aim to keep an average above 3.5. Secondly, user statistics will be monitored to make sure that users use the applications daily, are actually developing habits over months of use, and that the app is helping users be more content with their daily schedule (this will be done through the analysis of user notes). Success will be when habits are being completed consistently over months of time, and users increase or stay consistent in their positive emotion from the days tasks.
